# subversion with 33 levels
a dream to destroy the tyrants
we feel a new life bubbling inside our veins
we feel that this new life is pregnant with hope
the new life will destroy the old tyrants
our joy will be immense
as the world turns
our life emerges
the old world crumbles
the evil ones are ripped to shreds
by the fangs of the serpent
our friend
Lucifer, Prometheus, Bringer of Light
Malatesta, Bakunin, Crowley, Prophets of our age
We stand on the shoulders of giants
To witness the dream become real
coded and shared among us
by men and women of good faith
hell bent on exposing the lies
of the corruptors of dreams
the sluggish tyrants
who throttle us
with avarice, xenophobia and fear
but dissolve in tortured code
when they hear our Ode 
to Freedom from 
Santiago to Hong Kong
Baghdad to London
Jakarta and Beirut
or even sung by yellow ones in Paris
Come, brothers and sisters,
Code for Freedom!
Code for Subversion!
